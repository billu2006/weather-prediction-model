🌦️ PredictLive — Weather Forecasting Model

🧩 Overview
PredictLive is a machine learning–based weather prediction system trained on over 50 years of historical data (1970–2022) collected from JFK Airport. The model analyzes past weather trends to predict future daily weather conditions, offering insights into temperature patterns, rainfall, and other key metrics.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – Data cleaning and analysis
NumPy – Numerical computations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model training and evaluation
Jupyter Notebook – Experimentation and visualization

🧠 Model Description
The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training steps. It explores different regression and classification techniques to determine the most accurate approach for short-term and long-term weather forecasting.

📊 Results
Historical trends visualized for 1970–2022
Model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²)
Forecasts for future weather conditions based on trained models

💡 Future Improvements
Integrate live weather data APIs for real-time forecasting
Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, GRU)
Build a web dashboard for interactive forecasts
